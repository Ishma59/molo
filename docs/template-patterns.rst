Praekelt Molo Mobisite Design System
---------------------------------------

Molo design system a living document of visual design components, elements markups, which provides a set of reusable patterns that can be combined to make a cohesive website. It documents the visual language, such as header styles and color palettes, used to create the site. This way, it’s a one-stop place for the entire team—from clients and producers to designers and developers—to reference when discussing new site designs and iterations.

The design system will make it easy to build/scaffold custom Molo mobisites from our Python
Django Molo Framework with a consistent look and feel using predefined Molo Core patterns
and features - without reverse engineering our styles. The Design System and Molo Core serve
as a single source of truth for our Frontend Templates stack, to help us establish cohesive user experience,
common texonomy, enforce a modular approach and good quality code on mobile site applications.

Mote is a container that renders pattern libraries being built by Praekelt.com.
